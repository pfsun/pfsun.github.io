* I am a Senior Research Scientist at [Shape Security](https://www.shapesecurity.com/) based in Mountainview, CA. I received my Ph.D. degree in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.rutgers.edu/) from [Rutgers University](https://www.rutgers.edu/) in May, 2019, under the supervision of [Prof. Saman Zonouz](https://sites.google.com/site/samanzonouz4n6/saman-zonouz). Before that, I was pursuing my Master degree in [Peking University](http://english.pku.edu.cn/), Beijing, China, under the supervision of [Prof. Qingni Shen](http://www.ss.pku.edu.cn/index.php/shenqingni). During my master period, I was also one of visiting students at [Singapore Management University](https://www.smu.edu.sg/), Singapore, worked with [Prof. Xuhua Ding](http://www.mysmu.edu/faculty/xhding/).

* My research focuses on the intersection of Security, Privacy, and Data Analytics. Most of my work aims to solve software and system security problems by program analysis and data-driven techniques. My current and on-going work includes:
  * Online Fraud Detection, Bot Detection and Abnormal Detection
  * Embedded Systems Security
  * Malware Analysis and Reverse Engineering
  * Cyber-Physical Systems Resilience
  * Systems Security and Privacy
  * Intrusion Detection and Response Capabilities

* <b>Looking for potential research cooperation!</b> Please don't hesitate to email me if you are interested in developing novel technologies for the security and privacy.

* <b>Looking for contributing to Academic Community</b> as Conference/Journal Program Committee or Paper Reviewer.
